\subsection*{1.} Consider the surface $S$ given by all points $P(x,y,z)$ such that
\[ 
y = x^2, \qquad 0 \leq z \leq x^3, \qquad 0 \leq x \leq 1
.\]
Let $C$ denote the boundary curve of $S$.

\paragraph{(a)} Sketch the surface $S$.

\paragraph{(b)} Find a parametric representation of $S$ and calculate the surface normal vector $\Vec{N}$.

\paragraph{(c)} Find a parametric representation of $C$ such that $S$ is on the left hand side when going around $C$ in positive direction with the head in direction of $\Vec{N}$.

\paragraph{(d)} Calculate the line integral of
\[ 
\Vec{F} \left( \Vec{r} \right) = \left( x^3, x^2, x \right) 
\]
along the curve $C$ directly.

\paragraph{(e)} Calculate the line integral of $\Vec{F} \left( \Vec{r} \right) $ along the curve $C$ using Stoke's theorem.
